- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this problem, I learned how to utilize HTML and CSS to take on Frontend Mentor's QR Code Component Challenge. It wasn't too difficult to replicate the overall design, but adding in the little details to exactly copy was challenging. 

```html
<body>
  <div class="card">
    <img src="/images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr code">
    <div class="container">
      <p>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</p>

      <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="attribution">

    Coded by <a href="#">mddasian</a>.
  </div>
</body>
```
```css
.card {
    background-color: white;
    padding: 15px 15px 30px 15px;
    width: 320px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    text-align: center;
    font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
    box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    margin-bottom: 5px;
}
```

#Continued development
I hope to keep learning HTML and CSS to become more proficient at both of the languages. This was a fun challenge.
